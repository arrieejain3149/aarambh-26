## Firestore Data Model

| Collection | Description |
|---|---|
| `registrations` | Confirmed student registrations with payment details |
| `pendingRegistrations` | Temporary holding for in-progress payments |
| `roles` | User role assignments (`admin`, `scanner`, `volunteer`, `team_leader`, `feedback`) |
| `scanLogs` | QR check-in scan records with timestamps |
| `events` | Schedulable events and sub-events for the program |
| `announcements` | Platform-wide announcements pushed by admin |
| `notifications` | In-app notification objects |
| `volunteers` | Volunteer profiles and assignments |
| `dutyAssignments` | Per-volunteer duty schedules |
| `feedback` | Anonymous daily feedback submissions |
| `settings` | Dynamic app settings (e.g. active feedback day) |
| `auditLogs` | Immutable log of all admin and system actions |
| `scannerAccounts` | Scanner user credentials and status |
| `contact_messages` | Inbound contact form submissions |

---

## Security Model

Firestore security rules enforce strict role-based access control:

- **Public** — Can create pending registrations, submit feedback, send contact messages, read public events and announcements
- **`scanner` role** — Can read registrations and write scan logs (check-in)
- **`volunteer` / `team_leader` role** — Can read and update volunteer records
- **`feedback` role** — Can read feedback submissions
- **`admin` role** — Full read/write access to all collections

Security headers are applied globally via `next.config.mjs`:
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

### Production Rate Limiting (Cloudflare)

While the app includes an optimized, self-pruning in-memory rate limiter for local development and staging environments, it is recommended to configure rate limiting at the infrastructure layer in production.

To configure Cloudflare Rate Limiting (Free Tier):
1. Route the application traffic through Cloudflare (enable the **Proxied** status on your DNS record).
2. Go to **Security** -> **WAF** -> **Rate Limiting Rules** in the Cloudflare Dashboard.
3. Create a rule:
   - **Rule Name**: `API Rate Limit`
   - **Field**: `URI Path`
   - **Operator**: `starts with`
   - **Value**: `/api/`
   - **Action**: `Block` (or `JS Challenge`)
   - **Rate**: Set a reasonable limit, e.g., 5 requests per 1 minute.
4. Deploy the rule. This will block automated bots and scripts before they can reach the server or execute serverless execution time/database transactions.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start Next.js development server |
| `npm run build` | Build production bundle |
| `npm run start` | Start production server locally |

---

## Deployment

This project is deployed on **Firebase Hosting** with server-side rendering (SSR) enabled via Firebase App Hosting.

```bash
# Login to Firebase CLI
firebase login

# Deploy Firestore rules and indexes
firebase deploy --only firestore

# Deploy the full application (hosting + SSR backend)
firebase deploy
```

Ensure all production environment variables are set in your Firebase Hosting environment before deploying.

## Role Setup

After deploying, create user accounts in Firebase Authentication and assign roles via the `roles` Firestore collection:

```
/roles/{uid}
  role: "admin" | "scanner" | "volunteer" | "team_leader" | "feedback"
```

Only users with the `admin` role can access `/admin`. Only users with `scanner` can access `/scanner`.
